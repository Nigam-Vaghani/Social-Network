So basically, I need your help with some of my projects, college projects. We are building a particular project in Golang, basically. And our back-end is in Golang and front-end is in HTML, CSS, and use JavaScript sometimes. And what we are doing, basically, that like social network type things by the graph technology used in back-end. There are a list of users available on the web page, we can say. And their data is not stored in database. Any database connectivity are not there. We use JSON file for it. And there is a particular entry page. When user enters to the network, initially he has no connection or no friend. Then whenever user connect comes, that particular node is created. And initially it has zero edges because no connection. When he go to people list page, there is all the people is available. And every people have a add button. So when a person do add to any people, then he connected to that person by age. And everything is visualized at run-time with it. Graphical representation also at back-end side. That this type of thing. And direct research also.
